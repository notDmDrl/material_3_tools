# Material 3 Expressive tools

A set of utils that simplify usage of [Material Design 3 Expressive](https://m3.material.io/) (M3X) theming available in Flutter.

This is a highly opinionated package created for author's specific needs with no current intention for a public release via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). 
The only reason for the public repo is to be able to use the package outside my personal PC (ex. for work purposes).
