/// Material 3 Expressive [SpringDescription]s.
///
/// Expressive motion scheme has 3 preset motion schemes with 3 speeds each.
///
/// Spatial and effect springs come in three speeds: default, fast,
/// and slow. Most motion should use the default speed, while smaller elements
/// may use fast and larger elements may use slow.
///
/// Variants are:
///
/// * [Expressive spatial](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/overview/how-it-works#325277b0-f2fc-4be9-aa87-31cea6d1777d)
/// should be used for most situations, particularly hero moments and key interactions.
/// * [Standard spatial](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/overview/how-it-works#3990a20e-9cd2-4b8d-89b0-31cbc6ce346c)
/// should be used for utilitarian products.
/// * [Effects](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/overview/how-it-works#a7deb339-30ae-4559-9140-d7b7e29e68c6)
/// should be used to animate properties such as color and opacity animations, where there shouldnâ€™t be any overshoot.
